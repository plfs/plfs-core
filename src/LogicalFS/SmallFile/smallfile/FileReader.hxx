/**
 * This class implement buffered file reading.
 *
 * The basic algorithm is as following:
 *     -# Allocate a buffer with the given size.
 *     -# Read data from file to the buffer.
 *     -# If the next record is completely in the buffer, we are done.
 *     -# If the record is incomplete, allocate a buffer to hold it and then
 *        read the next buffer block.
 *
 * The derived classes should implement a function to get the size of the
 * given record. And then the derived class could call front() and pop_front()
 * to read the records one by one.
 *
 * The buffer size MUST be aligned to 4 bytes.
