Issue #159
In some cases a PLFS file will appear as a directory. This is because a PLFS
container is actually a directory. In the case where a user does not have
execute permission on a PLFS file (other than the owner) they cannot examine
the contents and determine if that file is a PLFS container or a regular
directory. There's no way around this without jeopardizing the security of 
the PLFS file since the execute bit opens it up to vulnerabilities.
