.SH NAME
plfs_trunc
.SH SYNTAX
#include <plfs.h>
.PP
int plfs_trunc( Plfs_fd *, const char *path, off_t, int open_file );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Truncate a file.  Cause the regular file named by path or referenced
by Plfs_fd to be truncated to a size of precisely off_t bytes. See
.I truncate(2)
for more information.  Truncating a PLFS file to size 0 is a very fast
operation but truncating to trim only some of the contents can be slow
for large files created by large numbers of writers.

.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.TP 1i
Plfs_fd
the file handle returned from plfs_open
.TP 1i
path
path to file to truncate
.TP 1i
off_t
bytes to truncate
.TP li
open_file
Boolean telling whether or not the file is currently open

.SH RETURN VALUES
Most PLFS functions return 0 or -errno, except write and read
which return the number of bytes or -errno
