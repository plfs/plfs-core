.SH NAME
PLFS (Parallel Log Structured File System) \- General Information
.SH SYNOPSIS
PLFS is a parallel virtual file system that improves concurrent write 
performance to a shared file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
In many parallel file systems such as Lustre, GPFS, and PanFS, concurrent
writes from large numbers of processes to a shared file suffers poor 
performance due to low-level serialization in the parallel file system.
PLFS transparently rearranges concurrrent writes to avoid this serialization.

.SH USING PLFS
There are three ways to use PLFS.
.PP
PLFS-MNT 
.I (see also plfs(1))
.RS
This interface provides the most transparency to the user.  PLFS is mounted
as a file system and users simply perform normal file system operations.  
This option requires FUSE.  Although this option gives improved performance,
very large-scale parallel applications are encouraged to use the PLFS-MPI-IO
interface which provides even larger improvements.
.RE
.PP
PLFS-MPI-IO
.RS
This is the highest performing interface for PLFS for very large-scale
parallel applications.  To use this option, applications must use the
MPI-IO interface and prepend plfs: to their paths.  For example, the path 
for restart could be 
.I plfs:/scratch/user/restart_file
This option requires use of an MPI that has been patched with PLFS.
.RE
.PP
PLFS-API
.I (see also plfs(3))
.RS
Finally, users can interface with PLFS directly by rewriting their applications
to use the PLFS API.  Although this requires the most user effort,
it is possible to use this interface by minimally
using just plfs_open(), plfs_write(), plfs_read, and plfs_close().
All PLFS functions are either approximations of POSIX file IO calls or
utility functions.

.SH FILES
In order to use any of these interfaces, a configuration file must be
present on the system. (see plfsrc(5)).
