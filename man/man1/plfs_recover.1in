.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./plfs_recover <
.I file
.B .

.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility attempts to recover a lost PLFS file or directory.  PLFS files
shouldn't be lost but if the set of backends for an existing mount point is
ever modified in the plfsrc, then PLFS files can be lost.  They will show up in
a readdir() but will return ENOENT on a stat().  This utility will recover the
file.  If plfs_recover ever successfully reports that a file was recovered but
the file remains invisible, then plfs_recover should be used to recover every
directory component of the file starting at the plfs mount point.
