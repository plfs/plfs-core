plfs_flatten_index
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./plfs_flatten_index <
.I file
.B >

.SH DESCRIPTION
Flatten the index for 
.I file
.B .
This utility optimizes a PLFS file for subsequent reads.  For large files
created by a large number of writers, the runtime of this utility can be
quite large but it will be worth it for improved read performance.  Note
that a better way to optimize PLFS files for subsequent reads is to
write them using the PLFS-MPI-IO interface and set hint plfs_flatten_close to
1.
