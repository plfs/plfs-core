                    ACE: Analysis of Coordinated Executions
                        An Analysis Framework for PLFS
###############################################################################

A tool for use within PLFS to visualize data and how it is stored in PLFS.
Graphs and visualizes bandwidths, I/Os in flight, the physical file layout,
the offsets written by each processor, and the times each processor was
writing.

***************************************************************************
System Requirements
***************************************************************************

The framework requires Swig, mpi, Matplotlib, networkx, and Wxpython
(wxpython is required only for the interactive interface and mpi is only
required for the parallel version. There is a serial version that does not
require mpi)

***************************************************************************
Installing
***************************************************************************

The framework is installed with PLFS. By default, ACE is not installed. In
order to install ACE with PLFS, set the environment variable PLFS_ACE to 1
before building. For more information about how to
install PLFS, please see README.install in the main folder. If you are unable
to find mpi, when running CMAKE try setting -DMPI_INCLUDE_PATH and 
-DMPI_LIBRARY to your specific version of mpi. 

***************************************************************************
Using the Framework
***************************************************************************

The following is a quick-start guide for using the framework to produce
a pdf. To start the interactive features, please see README.documentation.
For more information about features, see README.documentation.

Quick Start Guide:
1) Go into analysis.sh and adjust the top two variables to match the
PLFS file you wish to analyze. Make sure to give a parallel file system
as the second variable. If you are using a SLURM system, use analysis_slurm.sh
instead. 
2) Within analysis.sh, adjust the mpi run command based on your current
mpi system. (For example, on a Cray machine, you will use the aprun command)
3) Submit analysis.sh to your job scheduler and a pdf will be produced
that analyzes your file. You should submit the job from within the
scripts/analysis folder.
